This This script reads each line of the file and writes each of them to a separate file, which is placed in the subdirectory corresponding to the first letter of the line. That is, if a file contains three lines, one of which begins with A, the second with B, and the third with A again, the script should generate three files and place the first and third in the A directory, and the second in the B directory.

Use the next construction to run this script:

`chmod +x input.sh`

`input.sh text.xt`
